[Source:](https://www.scc.ca/en/system/files/publications/SIRB_RG_National-Community-Sourced-Guidelines_v2_2021-03-04.pdf)

## Introduction

A Community-Sourced Deliverable (CSD) is developed as a result of the collection of information using online platforms and allows for the continuous renewal of content , which is of paramount
importance. This process does not require the full consensus associated with the development of a National Standard of Canada (NSC).

This repository aims to offer a publicly‐accessible, online collaborative mechanism to capture current practice, state‐of‐the‐art knowledge and stakeholder understanding on an emerging/existing area or technology. It may be suitable for global collaboration.

## Definitions

* **Maintenance** The action by the developer to maintain the content of the CS relevant.
